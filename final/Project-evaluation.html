    <h2>Project Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The journey of construction of a website on the issue of global warming for me is absolutely interesting and challenging since I have had the opportunity to learn many new things. For me, I learned a few things about how real this problem of climate change is and the accelerated rate at which it will advance if concrete solutions are not found and implemented immediately. I may appreciate more the thorough material, but what more would be better to keep the visitors' attention on the site is more interactive elements. </p>
    <p>The process of color usage and fonts selection, putting much attention to the fact that the problem is very important and ensuring an easy readability, was very intentional. As new revisions are done, enhancing the speed of the website and the mobile friendly experience will be given more attention. </p>

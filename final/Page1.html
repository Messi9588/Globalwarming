    <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
    <p>Moreover, the main factor behind global warming is the growth of greenhouse gases in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere which possess carbon dioxide and methane particularly because of coal mining and deforestation. The planet is warming at an alarming rate due to the emission of greenhouse gases which traps heat in the atmosphere. However, understanding these causes is very important while one aims to address this issue.</p>
